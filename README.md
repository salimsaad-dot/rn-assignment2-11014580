DESCRIPTION:The code is written in React Native, a framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
The App component is defined as a default export. It serves as the entry point for my app.
Inside the App component, there’s a View component with the style defined by the styles.container object.
I set the background color of the View is set to #00ffff (a light blue shade).
The Text component displays the text “My name is” followed by my bolded name “Amuzuloh Salim Saad.”
The StatusBar component is included with the style set to “auto,” which means it adapts to the platform’s status bar appearance.
